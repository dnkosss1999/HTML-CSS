    <p style="color: crimson;">Every page and every image on a website has a URL (or Uniform Resource Locator). The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the path to that page or image.</p></br>
    <p style="color: crimson;">Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This will give them a more positive impression of your site and may encourage them to visit it for longer. (It also helps people using screen reader software.)</p>
